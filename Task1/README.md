# Module 3 Task 1: PROJECT FOR Blackwell Electronics (Predicting_Costumer_Preferences)
## MARTA VENEGAS PARDO (UBIQUM CODE ACADEMY)
RProject 

Working with Danielle Sherman, the Chief Technology Officer at Blackwell Electronics. 

The company has recently begun to leverage the data collected from online and in-store transactions to gain insight into their customers' purchasing behavior.
I will be using data mining methods to develop predictive models with R to predict which brand of computer products Blackwell customers prefer based on customer 
demographics collected from a marketing survey, will try to determine associations between products that be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives such as 
recommender systems like the ones used by Amazon and other eCommerce sites. 



## Skills applicable to data mining tasks:
 
- Data mining in e-commerce (e.g. profitability prediction, customer segmentation, product selection strategy)
- Preprocessing data for data mining (e.g., applying filters, addressing missing data)
- Using data mining tools and different classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, support vector machines) to develop predictive models
- Using the R statistical programming language
- Using the caret package for R
- Applying machine learning techniques to classification and regression problems
- Optimizing classifiers by adjusting and testing classifier parameters
- Applying cross-validation methods
- Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
- Comparing and selecting different predictive models
- Applying predictive models to test sets
- Presenting data mining results to management.
 

## What will I learn?

- Exploring the patterns in the data to create models to predict new events, like customer product preferences. 
- Pptimize the initial performance of a classifier by adjusting its parameters. 
- Interpreting the output of a classifier by selecting from different classifiers to compare their performance characteristics.
